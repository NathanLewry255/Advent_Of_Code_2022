# Advent_Of_Code_2022

This was a series of Puzzles uploaded to the Advent Of Code Website, running from the 1st DEC to 25th.

My code here is not representative, as I had a private race against my partner to see who could solve the puzzles
the fastest, though some classes were reformatted in post to clean up duplicate code.

I also used this as a sandbox to try out different C# features such as Lambda (throughout) and Array Ranges (day five).

To view the prompts that Advent of Code provided, go to their website at https://adventofcode.com/ and navigate to Events, 2022.

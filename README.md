# Advent_Of_Code_2022

This was a series of Puzzles uploaded to the Advent Of Code Website, running from the 1st DEC to 25th DEC.

My code here is not representative, as this was a race against the clock to see who could get the puzzles done the fastest, meaning that there are probably much faster and more optimized ways to get the solution than I have in my solutions.

I also used this as a sandbox to try out different C# features such as Lambda (throughout) and Array Ranges (day five).

To view the prompts that Advent of Code provided, go to their website at https://adventofcode.com/ and navigate to Events, 2022.
